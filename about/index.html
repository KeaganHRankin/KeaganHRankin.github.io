            <h1>Biography</h1>
            <p>
                I am a graduate student and engineer using my spare time to explore writing, philosphy and athletics. <br>
                I am a Masters of Applied Science student at University of Toronto 
                focused on aligning long-term human development with natural systems. My current 
                research uses tools from industrial ecology, data science, and systems modelling
                to find ways of providing more housing with less embodied greenhouse gas emissions. <br>
                I am currently a Junior Fellow at 
                Massey College and sits on the board of CCRI – Canada’s oldest housing co-op.
                I am excited about science outreach; I have created tools based on my research (which you may find on this website),
                and I have given public and private talks on topics ranging from existential technological risk
                to the evil of basements.
                Outside of academia, I am an experienced rower and have coached the sport for several years.
